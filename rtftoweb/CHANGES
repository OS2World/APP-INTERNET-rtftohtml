CHANGES to rtftoweb/rtftohtml

----------- ??.02.96: Released rtftoweb 1.7 --------------------------------

07.02.96

  - Improved the automatically generated index: Identical or similar
    consecutive index entries are now grouped. This makes the appearance
    of the index much clearer.
  - Incorporated (revised and simplified) patches of Daniel Lichau:

       1. Cross references to heading (marked by the color red) are now
          always case-insensitive.
       2. The SmallCaps/AllCaps attribute inside headings is now correctly
	  handled.
       3. The same should apply for hidden text inside headings.

05.02.96

  - Extended the nav-panel: Now the color of links, visited links and active
    links can be changed (requires Netscape). Also, it is now possible to
    have "fake" buttons included if there is no previous, next etc. page.
    This results in the navigation panel always looking the same.
  - Netscape 2.0 offers a nice new feature that I couldn't resist to support:
    Frames. If the -F command line option is given to rtftohtml, the title
    file will define a frame set, with the table of contents displayed in the
    left frame and the actual title page in the right. Obviously, this requires
    the -c option so that a ToC is generated.
    The same ("framed") page can also be viewed by browser which don't
    understand frames!

02.02.96

  - CHRIS:
    Subscript is now supported. In fact, it has always been, the problem
    was that Winword uses rtfSubScrShrink instead of rtfSubScript for
    marking subscripted text. Added "case rtfSubScrShrink" to CharAttr()
    in rtftohtml.c.
  
01.02.96

  - The -s command line option now creates files with "htm" extension instead
    of "html". Should simplify port to resp. use under DOS.
  - Newline characters (i.e. line breaks) inside headings are now correctly
    translated.
  - The maximal number of headings is no longer limited to 1024. Instead,
    memory required is allocated dynamically.
  - The first heading is regarded as a level 1 heading to avoid "lost"
    headings if it is at another level. Note that headings can still get
    lost inside an "internal" table of contents (ie the one displayed at
    the top of each HTML-page if there are lower level headings). For example
    a heading sequence of "Level 1, Level 3, Level 4, Level 2" causes the
    level 2 heading to disappear from the ToC, since its level is higher
    then of the heading immediately following the level 1 heading. This is
    due to the recursive nature of headline processing, and I don't consider
    this as being a bug. The headings should reflect the logical structure
    of the document, so it is recommended that a heading of level n is
    followed either by a heading at the same of higher level, or at level n+1.
  - rtftohtml now prints a warning if the case described in the previous point
    is encountered.
    
31.01.96

  - hierHeadingLevel now only deals with the primary style, not with styles
    the current one is based on. Avoids false splits.
  - Implemented patch provided by James (jkb@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk). rtftoweb
    now no longer requires headings in the .PTag table (defined in html-trans)
    to start with "h?".
    Instead, it looks at the TocStyl number to determine if the current style
    is a heading or not. I really wonder why I haven't implemented it like
    that right away! Oh well...
  - The same patch allows for customised start and end tags for headings,
    e.g.:  "h2","<hr><h2>\n","</h2>\n","\t","\t","<br>\n",0,0,0,1,2
    draws a horizontal ruler above each level 2 heading. Again, I have to
    wonder... Thanks a lot, James!

30.01.96

  - Fixed "Unknown Class" bug: I just forgot to reset a flag in hierGroup.
    This bug could appear if the RTF-file contained auto-numbered headings
    or lists.
  - CHRIS:
    Fixed "Invalid Character Code" messages by adding entries to ansi-gen
    and ansi-sym. In fact, these codes were not "invalid" but rather unknown.
    These are the added entries:
	  ellipsis  0x85
	  bullet    0xb7
    Note that further such messages can be fixed by adding similar values
    to the appropriate files (depending on the charset used).
  - CHRIS:
    Replaced the standard html-map with the one generously provided by
    Rainer Weidemann (weideman@iai.kfk.de). It contains translations for
    virtually all special characters accessible from WinWord (e.g. sterling).
  

----------- 03.09.95: Released rtftoweb 1.6 --------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.5 to 1.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I released rtftoweb 1.5, I thought it would be the last version of
rtftoweb since I agreed with Chris Hector, the author of the original 
rtftohtml, that rtftoweb should be integrated into rtftohtml.  That was at
the end of 1994, but no new version of rtftohtml was released since then.
Chris told me that he has currently (and during the last monts) too many
other things to do, and that he will not be able to continue the development
of rtftohtml within the next few months. Because of this, and because
I keep getting bug reports and suggestions from rtftoweb users I decided
to release another (intermediate) version of rtftoweb.

Among the new features are:

	o rtftoweb now creates clean HTML
	o the layout of the navigation panel now is fully customizable
	o Netscape users can specify additional layout features
	o the <center> tag of Netscape is supported
	o empty headings are ignored
	o if email addresses and URLs are colored red in the RTF file,
	  an HTML hyperlink will automatically be generated
	o some bug fixes
	
This is a detailed list of the changes since rtftoweb-1.5:

03.09.95 (and during the weeks before)

  - New command line option: -s, tells rtftoweb to use short, numbered file
    names if the HTML output is to be split.
  - rtftoweb now checks if a heading is longer then 256 characters and
    ignores it if this is the case. A warning is printed, too, since
    the author most certainly didn't want such a long heading in his/her
    document.
  - Auto-numbered headings are now fully supported.
  - Internal cross references (created by text formatted as "_Name" and
    "_Href") are now correctly resolved across file boundaries.
  - FlushHTML() rewritten so that no newline is written to the output file
    when this proc is invoked.

06.08.95

  - Changed two things in html-trans to work better with WinWord:
    Added "Courier New" to the list of monospaced fonts and added a line
    for hidden and strokethrough text to generate literal HTML.
    
04.08.95

  - If the file "nav-panel" exists in rtftohtml's library directory (that is
    where html-map etc. live), it is automatically read if no -N option was
    given to rtftohtml.
  - Email addresses and URIs in the RTF text are now also recognized as
    HTML references if they are colored red (as is usual for cross references
    inside the document).

03.08.95

  - Fixed bug in htmlout.c (nextfield) which caused the 81st character of 
    non-wrappable lines to be lost.
  - Work-around for a bug introduced by Winword 6.0: It pretends that the
    character set used in an RTF file written by it is always ANSI, although,
    when the source of the RTF-file was a Mac-Word-document, the character
    set is still MAC. The shell-script rtfcharset can be used to fix this,
    e.g. by saying "rtfcharset foo.rtf mac".
31.07.95

  - The navigation panel now is completely configurable!  This is accomplished
    by using a simple configuration file which specifies the panel elements
    and thus allows for navigation buttons to be images. The conf-file is
    given to rtftohtml via the -N option.
  - Some more Netscapisms: The nav-panel config-file can also be used to
    specify background images and colors, text color and the appearane of 
    horizontal rules.
    
30.07.95

  - Empty headlines are ignored now.
  - Corrected HTML of footnote and index files.
  - Added support for Netscape's <center> tag.

29.07.95

  - html-map: &nbsp; is not supported by any HTML-browser I know, mapped
    nobrkspace to "&#160;"
  - text of optional RTF-destinations in headings is now ignored
  - removed interpretation of bookmarks as being anchors (this was not
    working right) 
  - added support for castilian spanish (thanks to Pedro Bayon)
  - fixed a bug that caused image files to be overwritten (thanks to 
    Toni Verdu)  
  - changed <a><h?>...</h?></a> to <h?><a>...</a></h?>
  - The rtftoweb patches now generate clean HTML!
  - Anchors of index anchors don't contain any text anymore, since Mosaic
    and the Mosaic-based Chimera are the only browsers which (falsely) 
    require non-empty anchors. An anchor text may be specified using the
    command line option "-X <text>". <text> could be for example &#183;
    as suggested by Alan Flavell.
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from 1.4 to 1.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE IS ...
================================

...that version 1.5 is the last version of rtftoweb. From this version on
Chris Hector, the author of the original rtftohtml filter, will incorporate
the rtftoweb patches into rtfothml. I think this will make life easier for
everyone (except Chris's, perhaps :-), since you won't have to deal with
compatiblity problems any longer. So, in the future, please send all bug
reports, questions and suggestions that you may have to Chris (cjh@cray.com).

Thank you, and look forward to the forthcoming versions of rtftohtml!
