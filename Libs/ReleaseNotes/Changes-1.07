Changes for RTF distribution release 1.07
-----------------------------------------

Added recognition for a lot more symbols.  This involves more defines, and
I renumbered many of the existing ones.  These changes are mostly isolated
to rtf.h and reader.c; the translators (rtf2text.c, rtf2troff.c, etc.) have
not yet been updated to take advantage of many of these new symbols.  It
is somewhat unlikely that they will be any time soon, either.  Most of the
new symbols are of the sort that add capability to the standard for things
that are difficult to perform any meaningful sort of translation for
(such as objects) or for things that have no meaning to any of the translators
provided in the distribution (such as paragraph background shading).

Changed rtfDiBitmap to rtfDevIndBitmap.
Changed rtfTextDist to rtfTextDistX since there's now a Y control, too.
The text for rtfLeaderBar was "bar", which is incorrect, I think.  Changed
to "brdrbar".

The Normal style is now referenced internally as rtfNormalStyleNum (222),
not 0.  That's the same value Microsoft assigns to the Normal style.  The
reader treats any explicit references to style 0 that may be present in
the source document as references to 222.

8-bit input characters are not normally allowed, but some RTF writers such
as WriteNow on the NeXT write such characters.  They used to be flagged
or cause an error, now they're turned into the equivalent \'xx hex control.
I don't really know if that's a good thing to do, though.

Made the changes necessary to allow the distribution to compile under
THINK C (6.0).  Mainly as an experiment; I don't know if the programs
are at all useful in that environment.  The modifications are things
triggered by #ifdef THINK_C; since THINK C doesn't run under an environment
conducive to configuration via imake, it's necessary to use ugly inline
conditionals.
