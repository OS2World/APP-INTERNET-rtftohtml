Changes for RTF distribution release 1.09
-----------------------------------------

Most of the changes for this release are additions to the reader to handle
the zillion new control words documented in version 1.2 of
the RTF Specification.

\cs (character style) is now classified in the rtfCharAttr class rather
than in the rtfParAttr class.  \ds (section style) is now classified in
the rtfSectAttr class rather than in the rtfParAttr class.
