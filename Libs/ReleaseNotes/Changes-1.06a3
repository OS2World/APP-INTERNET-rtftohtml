Changes for RTF distribution release 1.06a3
-------------------------------------------

-----------------------------
the RTF reader:

Discard nulls now, not just \r and \n.

The "Normal" style may be specified with no style number.

Previously, checked for "Normal"; now check only first 6 characters,
since the name for the normal style in some documents has stuff
following, e.g., "Normal,Times 10 point".  Some German readers apparently
use "Standard" for "Normal", so check that, too.

Added recognition for special character controls \bullet, \emdash, \endash,
\lquote, \rquote, \ldblquote, \rdblquote (and added sporadic support in
various writers).

Style reader ignores {\*\keyword ... } group inside of style definitions.
It's not clear to me yet what I should do with these things, if anything.

Added recognition for more keywords.
