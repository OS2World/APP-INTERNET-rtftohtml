Changes for RTF distribution release 1.06a2
-------------------------------------------

-----------------------------
the RTF reader:

Fixed bug causing literal tabs to be returned improperly.

Minor support for NeXT graphic attributes.  Still no access to a NeXT,
so this is still all guesswork.

Defined (in rtf.h) a typedef RTFFuncPtr which is a pointer to a function
returning void.  It's used in connection with callbacks and read hooks
for easier source reading (and typing).

RTFUngetToken() added; pushes the last token read back on the input stream.

RTFPeekToken() added.  Looks at (but does not gobble) next token.


-----------------------------
rtfdiag:

Fixed off-by-one error in argument processing loop.  Sheesh.

Understands how to deal with multiple file arguments now.


-----------------------------
rtf2troff:

Fixed off-by-one error in argument processing loop.  Sheesh again.
