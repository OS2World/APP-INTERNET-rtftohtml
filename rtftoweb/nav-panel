# This file is used for customizing the layout of the navigation panels
# created by rtftoweb. It also lets you configure a few of Netscape's
# own document options such as background and text color.  You can tell
# rtftoweb to load a customization file like this one by the command
# line option "-N <file>".  If the file "nav-panel" exists in
# rtftohtml's library directory and no -N option was given the
# navigation panel layout will be read from that file.
# 
# Each of the following lines define a certain panel element. Everything
# that follows the first colon will be literally inserted into the html
# files.  This way it is possible to have inline images as navigation
# buttons.
# 

# these define the buttons of the navigation panels:
previous.:<IMG SRC="granite_left.gif" ALT="<< ">
next.....:<IMG SRC="granite_right.gif" ALT=">> ">
up.......:<IMG SRC="granite_up.gif" ALT="Up ">
title....:<IMG SRC="granite_top.gif" ALT="Title ">
contents.:<IMG SRC="granite_contents.gif" ALT="Contents ">
index....:<IMG SRC="granite_index.gif" ALT="Index">

# the following maybe specified to display, say, a "previous" button, even if
# there is no previous document (so that the nav panel always looks the same):
noprev...:<IMG SRC="granite_left_blur.gif" ALT="<< ">
nonext...:<IMG SRC="granite_right_blur.gif" ALT="<< ">
noup.....:<IMG SRC="granite_up_blur.gif" ALT="Up ">
notitle..:<IMG SRC="granite_top_blur.gif" ALT="Title ">

# the delimiter between navigation items:
delimiter: 

# definition for the horizontal line:
hr.......:<HR SIZE=4>

#---------------
#
# The following lines specify additional document options to date only
# supported by Netscape. The values entered here will apply to every
# HTML-file created from the RTF document.
#

# an optional background image (just the filename):
bgimage...:

# if bgimage is not used, the background color can be specified as #rrggbb:
#bgcolor...:#ffffff

# this sets the text color of the document:
#textcolor.:#0000ff

# the color of links (default blue):
#linkcolor.:#00ff00

# the color of visited links (default purple):
#vlinkcolor:#009900

# the color of active links (default red):
#alinkcolor:#aa00aa
