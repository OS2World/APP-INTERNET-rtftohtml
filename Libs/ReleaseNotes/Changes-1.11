Changes for RTF distribution release 1.11
-----------------------------------------

Changed the reader so that the control symbol table isn't compiled into
reader.c, but is read from the library file "rtf-ctrl".  rtf-ctrl is
created by mkrtf-ctrl.c (the table *is* compiled into that program, and
it just generates the corresponding text file so that the major and
minor numbers are correct).

Fixed a bug in the RTFAlloc() #define in rtf.h.


Macintosh wrapper:

- Wrapper must be compiled with TransSkel 3.15 or higher.  It will not
compile with releases earlier than 3.13.  It will *compile* with 3.13
or 3.14, but those releases have a bug that affects the RTF translators.

- Default folder shown for output files in the putfile dialog is now set
using the standard mechanism provided for that by System 7 rather than
by setting low memory globals.

- Pathnames are now constructed using "/" as the path component delimiter
if A/UX is running.  (The delimiter is returned by the PathSepChar()
function.)

- Prefs file reading/writing routines no longer take file name or creator
type as arguments.  These are taken from 'STR ' 1001 and 'BNDL' 128 now.

- Translations can now be terminated early.  Typing command-period when
the status window is frontmost during a translation terminates the
translation.  If 'CNTL' resource 1000 is present (it should be a "Cancel"
button), the status window also has a Cancel button for terminating the
translation.
