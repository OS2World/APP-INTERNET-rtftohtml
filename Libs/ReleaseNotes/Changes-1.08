Changes for RTF distribution release 1.08
-----------------------------------------

Now configured with WRPRC2 imake configuration files.

The char->hex and hex->char functions are now public since some of the
writers need them.  (The functions are RTFCharToHex(), RTFHexToChar())

Fixed some errant calls to RTFSetToken() to pass rtfNoParam rather than -1
when no parameter value was intended.  Also fixed description of RTFSetToken()
in rtf.ms.

rtf2troff:

Incorporated Dave Davey's mods to handle characters in symbol font.
See trf-symbol.c.  Also several entries for the maps in trf-charmap.c
Added -h/+h options to control whether header/footer macros and traps are
generated, with the default being off.  This is based on the presumption
that the output is likely to be run through some troff with some macro
package anyway, and that package will supply space at the top/bottom of
the page.

Made groff the default troff version.

rtf2text:

Incorporated Mike Sendall's entries for the maps.
