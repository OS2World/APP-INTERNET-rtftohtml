Users Guide
</a></h1>
This document contains directions for using the <i>rtftohtml</i> filter. <p>
There are two ways that the rtftohtml filter may be used. You can take existing
documents and translate them to HTML, or write new documents explicitly for the
World Wide Web. This filter should accomodate both uses.
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC2">An
Overview of rtftohtml
</a></h1>
rtftohtml reads up RTF format documents and translates them to HTML. In
processing text, the filter chooses HTML markup based on three characteristics.
These are
<ol>
<li>	The destination of the text. Example destinations are header, footer,
nootnote, picture.
<li>	The paragraph style. Paragraph styles are user-definable entities, but
some are pre-defined by the word processing package. For Microsoft Word (on the
Macintosh) examples are "Normal" and "heading 1". 
<li>	The text attributes.  Examples of text styles are bold, courier, 12
point.</ol><p>
The filter has built-in rules for dealing with destinations. For paragraph and
text styles, the rules for translation are contained in a file called
html-trans. By modifying this file, you can train rtftohtml to perform the
correct translations for your documents. The most common change that you will
need to make is to add your own paragraph styles to html-trans.<p>
<p>
rtftohtml should produce reasonable HTML output for most documents. Here is
what you can expect:
<ul>
<li>	Your output should appear in a file called "xx.html" where "xx" or
"xx.rtf" was your input file name.
<li>	Bold, italic and underlined text should appear with &lt;b&gt;,&lt;i&gt;
and &lt;u&gt; markup
<li>	Courier font text should appear with &lt;tt&gt; markup
<li>	Tables will be formatted using &lt;pre&gt; markup (only plain text is
supported in tables.)
<li>	Footnotes will appear in a separate document with hypertext links to them.
<li>	Table of contents, indexes, headers and footers are discarded.
<li>	Table of Contents entries and paragraphs with the style "heading 1..6"
will generate a hypertext Table of Contents in a separate file. Each table of
contents entry will link to the correct location in the main document.
<li>	All paragraph styles use in your document must appear in the file
"html-trans". This allows you to create a mapping from any paragraph style to
any HTML markup. There are many pre-defined styles in html-trans, including
"heading 1..6". (If a paragraph style is not found, a warning will be generated
and the text will be written to the HTML file with no special markup.)
<li>	Each graphic in your file will be written out to a separate file. The
filename will be "xxn.ext" where "xx" or "xx.rtf" was your input, "n" is a
unique number and "ext" will be either "pict" for Macintosh PICT format
graphics  or "wmf" for Windows Meta-Files format graphics. The HTML file will
create links to these files, using either "&lt;A HREF=" or "&lt;IMG SRC="
links. <b>SINCE most WWW browsers do not understand "wmf" or "pict" format
files, the link will be to xxn.gif.  </b>This presumes that you will run some
<b>other</b> filter to translate your graphic files to gif.
<li>	Text that is connected with copy/paste-link constructs will generate
hypertext links.</ul>
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC3">How
it works
</a></h1>
rtftohtml begins by reading html-trans and the character translation files. The
rest of the processing is a loop of reading your RTF file and writing HTML. A
high level overview of this loop looks like this:
<ol>
<li>	Read the next character. In doing so, the filter also reads all of the RTF
markup that specifies the destination, paragraph and text styles of the next
character.
<li>	Process the destination information. Normally, text is destined for the
"body" of the document. Sometimes, the text belongs in a header, footnote or
footer. The filter discards any text for headers, footers. For a footnote, the
filter writes the text at the end of the document and generates a link to it.
<li>	Process any SPECIAL text styles. The filter compares the text style
information to see if it matches any entries in the .TMatch table (in
html-trans). If there is a match and the entry is for "_Discard", "_Literal",
"_Hot", "_HRef", "_Name" or "_Footnote" then the text will be processed
accordingly. For example, "_Discard" text is discarded and "_Name" text will
generate an anchor using the text as a name.
<li>	If the text was not SPECIAL, process the paragraph style. The filter takes
the name of the paragraph style and looks it up in the list of paragraph styles
in html-trans (in the .PMatch table). If the paragraph style is not found in
the table it uses the first entry : "Normal". This entry has a nesting level
and the name of the HTML "paragraph"<a href="Users_Guide_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>
markup to use. Using the HTML paragraph" markup name, the filter (using the
.PTag table) knows what tags to generate for the text. 
<li>	If the text was not SPECIAL, process the text styles again. The filter
compares the text style information to see if it matches any entries in the
.TMatch table (in html-trans). In this step, it is possible to match more than
one entry. For each matched entry in the .TMatch table,  the filter uses the
HTML "text" markup name, the filter (using the .TTag table) knows what tags to
generate for the text. </ol><p>
Using this process, the filter can generate any HTML markup for any combination
of paragraph style and text style. <p>

<h1>
<a name="RTFToC4">What
about Graphics?
</a></h1>
Graphics are imbedded in RTF in either a binary format or an (ASCII) hex dump
of that binary. I have never seen a binary format graphic  - I don't think that
the filter will process binary correctly. It does handle the hex format of
graphics, by converting the hex back into binary and writing the binary to a
file. The file extension is chosen by looking at the original type of the
graphic. The following list shows the file types and their extensions:<p>

<dl>
<dt>Macintosh PICT 
<dd>.pict  - also, 256 bytes of nulls are prepended to the graphic. This is to
conform to the PICT file format.
<dt>Windows Meta-files
<dd>.wmf <a href="Users_Guide_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>
<dt>Windows Bit-map
<dd>.bmp</dl><p>
In addition, the filter produces a link to the file containing the graphic.
Now, since the above graphic formats are not very portable, the filter assumes
that you will convert these files to something more useful, like GIF. So the
format of the link is:<p>
<tt>&lt;a href="basenameN.ext"&gt;Click here for a Picture&lt;/a&gt;</tt><p>
<tt></tt>where 
<ul>
<li>	<tt>basename</tt> is the name of the input document (without the .rtf
extension)
<li>	<tt>N</tt> is a unique number (starting at 1)
<li>	<tt>ext</tt> is an extension. This defaults to GIF, but can be overidden
with the -P command line option.
<li></ul>You can also change the link to an IMG form. If you specify the -I
command line option, all links to graphics will be of the form:<p>
<tt>&lt;IMG src="basenameN.ext"&gt;</tt><p>
<p>
There is one other special case. If a graphic is encountered when the filter is
in the process of generating a link, the IMG form of the link is used even
without the -I command line option.
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC5">Special
Processing
</a></h1>
In the following discussion of SPECIAL processing, I will assume that rtftohtml
has not been customized. If it has, the text styles used to create special
effects may be different. 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">Making
a Named Anchor
</a></h2>
To make a named anchor, you simply enter the name in the document where you
would like the anchor to appear. Then format the text using Outline and Hidden.
Be careful in formatting the text that you format ONLY the name - be careful
not to format leading and trailing spaces or paragraph marks. As an example, if
the text - Named Anchor Example - were formatted with Outline and Hidden, it
would produce the HTML output :<p>
&lt;a name="Named Anchor Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<p>
<p>
To change the formatting that produces named anchors, you need to modify the
entry in html-trans that specifies "_Name" formatting.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Footnote/Endnote
Processing
</a></h2>
If your RTF document contains footnotes or endnotes, the filter will place the
text of the footnotein  aseparate HTML document.  At the footnote reference
mark, the filter will generate a hypertext link to the text of the footnote.
This works with either automatically numbered footnotes<a
href="Users_Guide_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a>, or user supplied footnote reference
marks<a href="Users_Guide_fn.html#fn3">[+]</a> 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Discarding
Unwanted Text
</a></h2>
If you have text that you do not want to appear in the HTML output, simply
format the text as Hidden and Plain (that is, no underline, outline...). <p>
If you wish to modify the formatting that discards text, you need to change the
entry in html-trans that specifies "_Discard".<b></b>
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Imbedding
HTML in a Document
</a></h2>
Normally, if your RTF document contained the text
"&lt;cite&gt;hello&lt;/cite&gt;", the translator would output this as:
"&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;hello&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;". This ensures that the text
would appear in your HTML output exactly as it appeared in the original RTF
document. If, however, you want the &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; to be interpreted
as HTML markup, you must format the tags using Hidden and Shadow. The filter
will then send the tags through without translation. <p>
When the rtftohtml filter produces HTML markup, it keeps track of the nesting
level of tags to ensure that you don't get something like
&lt;b&gt;&lt;cite&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; which would be incorrect
markup. If you imbed HTML markup in your document, the filter will NOT be aware
of it. You must ensure that your markup appears correctly nested.<p>
If you wish to modify the formatting for imbedded HTML, you need to change the
entry in html-trans that specifies "_Literal".<b></b><p>
<b></b>
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC10">Customizing
rtftohtml
</a></h1>
Some customizations of rtftohtml require a little understanding of how the
filter work, others require a lot. All of the customizations involve editing
either html-trans or one of the character translation files. 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">html-trans
File Format
</a></h2>
In html-trans there are four tables. They are .PTag, .TTag, .PMatch and
.TMatch. These tables begin with the name (in column one) and continue until
the next table starts. All blank lines and lines beginning with a '#' are
discarded. '#' lines are typically used for comments. The tables themselves are
composed of records containing a fixed number of fields which are separated by
commas. The fields are either strings (which should be quoted) integers or
bitmasks.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC12">.PTag
Table
</a></h3>
Each entry in the .PTag table describes an HTML paragraph markup. The format
is: <p>
.PTag<p>
#"name","starttag","endtag","col2mark","tabmark","parmark",allowtext,cannest,DelteCol1,fold,TocStyl
<dl>
<dt><b>name</b>
<dd>A unique name for this entry. These names are referenced in the .PMatch
table.
<dt><b>starttag</b>
<dd>This string will be output once at the beginning of any text for this
markup.
<dt><b>endtag</b>
<dd>This string will be output once at the end of any text for this markup.
<dt><b>col2mark</b>
<dd>This string will be output  in place of the first tab in every paragraph
(used for lists)
<dt><b>parmark</b>
<dd>This string will be output in place of each paragraph mark. (usually
&lt;br&gt; or &lt;p&gt;)
<dt><b>allowtext</b>
<dd>If 0, no text markup will be allowed within this markup. (for example
&lt;pre&gt; or &lt;h1&gt; don't format well if they contain additional markup.
<dt><b>cannest</b>
<dd>If 1, other paragraph markup will be allowed to nest within this markup.
(used for nesting lists)
<dt><b>DeleteCol1</b>
<dd>If 1, all text up to the first tab in a paragraph will be deleted. (used to
strip out bullets that when going to unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;).
<dt><b>fold</b>
<dd>If 1, the filter will add newlines to the HTML to keep the number of
characters in a line to less than 80. For &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;listing&gt;
elements, this should be set to 0.
<dt><b>TocStyl</b>
<dd>The TOC level. If greater than 0, the filter will create a Table of
contents entry for every paragraph using this markup. </dl><p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC13">Sample
.PTag Entries
</a></h4>

<pre>
"h1","&lt;h1&gt;\n","&lt;/h1&gt;\n","\t","\t","&lt;br&gt;\n",0,0,0,1
</pre>
This
is a level 1 heading.  The "\n" in the start and end-tag fields forcesa newline
in the HTML markup. Since newlines are ignored in HTML (except in &lt;pre&gt;)
it's only effect is to make the HTML output more readable. There is no
difference between the first tab and any other. They both translate to a tab
mark. Paragraph marks generate "&lt;br&gt;" followed by a newline (just for
looks). Text markup (like &lt;b&gt;) is not allowed within &lt;h1&gt; text,
because we leave that up to the HTML client. No nesting is allowed - (see the
discussion on nested styles). No text is deleted. Every paragraph using this
markup will also generate a level-1 table of contents entry.

<pre>

"Normal","","\n","\t","\t","&lt;p&gt;\n",1,0,0,0
</pre>
This
is the default for normal text. Regular text in HTML has no required start and
end-tags. The "\n" in the end-tag field forces a newline in the HTML markup.
Since newlines are ignored in HTML (except in &lt;pre&gt;) it's only effect is
to make the HTML output more readable. There is no difference between the first
tab and any other. They both translate to a tab mark. Paragraph marks generate
"&lt;p&gt;" followed by a newline (just for looks). Text markup (like
&lt;b&gt;) is allowed within Normal text. No nesting is allowed - (see the
discussion on nested styles). No text is deleted.

<pre>

"ul","&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;","&lt;/ul&gt;","\t","\t","\n&lt;li&gt;",1,1,0,0
</pre>
This
is the entry for unordered lists. This generates a "&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;" at
the start of the list and "&lt;/ul&gt;/n" at the end. There is no difference
between the first tab and any other. They both translate to a tab mark.
Paragraph marks generate "&lt;li&gt;" preceded by a newline (just for looks).
Text markup (like &lt;b&gt;) is allowed, and this entry may be nested - and it
allows others to be nested within it. This allows nested lists. No text is
deleted.<p>


<pre>
"ul-d","&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;","&lt;/ul&gt;","\t","\t","\n&lt;li&gt;",1,1,1,0
</pre>
This
entry is identical to the previous except that the DeleteCol1 field is set to
1. This is used to remove bullets (which really appear in the RTF) because we
don't want to see them in the HTML.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC14">.TTag
Table
</a></h3>
Each entry in the .TTag table describes an HTML text markup. The format is: <p>
.TTag<p>
"name","starttag","endtag"
<dl>
<dt><b>name</b>
<dd>A unique name for this entry. These names are referenced in the .PMatch
table.
<dt><b>starttag</b>
<dd>This string will be output once at the beginning of any text for this
markup.
<dt><b>endtag</b>
<dd>This string will be output once at the end of any text for this
markup.</dl>Note that unlike the .PTag table, no text markup should appear more
than once. (Of course there is no good reason that it should appear.) If you
have two entries with &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; start and end tags, it would be
possible to get HTML of the form &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt; text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. I
don't know if this is invalid markup, but it sure is ugly.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC15">.PMatch
Table
</a></h3>
Each entry in the .PMatch correlates a paragraph style name to some entry in
the .PTag table. The format is: <p>
.PMatch<p>
"Paragraph Style",nesting_level,"PTagName"
<dl>
<dt><b>Paragraph Style</b>
<dd>The paragraph style name that appears in the RTF input.
<dt><b>nesting_level</b>
<dd>The nesting level. This should be zero except for nested list entries.
<dt><b>PTagName</b>
<dd>The name of the .PTag entry that should be used for paragraphs with this
paragraph style. </dl><p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC16">Sample
.PMatch Entries
</a></h4>

<pre>
"heading 1",0,"h1"
</pre>
This
is a level 1 heading.  Any paragraphs with this paragraph style will be mapped
to the entry in the .PTag table named "h1".

<pre>

"numbered list",0,"ol-d"
</pre>
This
is used for numbered lists.  Any paragraphs with this paragraph style will be
mapped to the entry in the .PTag table named "ol-d". 

<pre>

"numbered list 2",2,"ol-d"
</pre>
This
is an entry for a nested paragraph style. The nesting level of two is used to
indicate that this paragraph should appear in the HTML nested within two levels
of paragraph markups. The paragraph marked with this style may only appear
after  a paragraph style that has a nesting level of 1 or greater.

<pre>

</pre>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC17">.TMatch
Table
</a></h3>
Each entry in the .TMatch table describes processing for text styles. The
format is: <p>
.TMatch

<pre>
"Font",FontSize,Match,Mask,"TextStyleName"
</pre>
<dl>
<dt><b>Font</b>
<dd>The name of a Font, or "" if all fonts match this entry.
<dt><b>FontSize</b>
<dd>The point-size of the font, or 0 if all point sizes match this entry.,
<dt><b>Match</b>
<dd>A bit-mask, where each bit represents a text attribute. These bits are
compared to the attributes of the style being output. They must match for this
entry to be matched. One in a bit position means that the text style is set, a
zero is not set.
<dt><b>Mask</b>
<dd>A bit-mask, where each bit represents a text attribute. In comparing the
style of the text being processed, to the Match bit-mask, this field is used to
select the bits that matter. If a zero appears in a  bit-position, then that
style attribute is ignored (for the purpose of matching this entry.) Only 1
bits are used in the above comparision.
<dt><b>TextStyleName</b>
<dd>This is either the name of an entry in the .TTag table indicating the HTML
markup to use, or it is one of "_Discard", "_Name",  "_HRef", "_Hot", or
"_Literal".</dl>

<pre>
The order of bits in the Match and Mask bit-maps are:
#    v^bDWUHACSOTIB - Bold
#    v^bDWUHACSOTI - Italic
#    v^bDWUHACSOT - StrikeThrough
#    v^bDWUHACSO - Outline
#    v^bDWUHACS - Shadow
#    v^bDWUHAC - SmallCaps
#    v^bDWUHA - AllCaps
#    v^bDWUH - Hidden
#    v^bDWU - Underline
#    v^bDW - Word Underline
#    v^bD - Dotted Underline
#    v^b - Double Underline
#    v^ - SuperScript
#    v - SubScript
</pre>
<p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC18">Sample
.PTag Entries
</a></h4>

<pre>
# double-underline/not hidden -&gt; hot text
# double-underline/hidden -&gt; href
#    v^bDWUHACSOTIB,v^bDWUHACSOTIB
"",0,00100000000000,00100010000000,"_Hot"
"",0,00100010000000,00100010000000,"_HRef"
</pre>
The
first entry will match any text formatted with double underline EXCEPT if it is
hidden text. This is accomplished by using those two bits to compare (the MASK
field) and having a 1 in the double underline bit and a zero for the hidden
text bit. The second entry will match any text formatted with BOTH double
underline and hidden text. Any text that matches the first will be treated as
the hot text of a link. Any text that matches the second will be taken as the
href itself. (The filter requires that the HRef text immediately precede the
Hot text.) <p>


<pre>
# Regular matches - You can have multiple of these active
# monospace fonts -&gt; tt
"Courier",0,00000000000000,00000000000000,"tt"
</pre>
This
will match any text that uses the Courier font and mark it using the HTML text
markup appearing in the .TTag table with the entry name "tt".<p>


<pre>
# bold -&gt; bold
#    v^bDWUIACSOTIB,v^bDWUIACSOTIB
"",0,00000000000001,00000000000001,"b"
</pre>
This
will match any text that has bold attributes and will mark it using the HTML
text markup appearing in the .TTag table with the entry name "b". Note that
bold text using the Courier font would match both this entry and the previous.
This will yeild markup of the form &lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;hi&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;.
Note that "b" is the name of an entry in the .TTag table, not the HTML markup
that is used! <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC19">Adding
Paragraph Styles
</a></h2>
To add a new paragraph style, simply go to the .PMatch table and add an entry
to the end. Put the name of the paragraph style (quoted), the nesting level
(usually zero) and the name of the .PTag entry that should be used. 
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC20">Command
Line Options
</a></h1>
The syntax of the rtftohtml command is as follows:

<pre>
rtftohtml [-i] [ -V] [-o filename] [-P extension] [-T] [-G][file]
</pre>
<dl>
<dt><b>-i</b>
<dd>Indicates that imbedded graphics should be linked into the main document
using an IMG tag. The default is to use an HREF style link.
<dt><b>-V</b>
<dd>Prints the current Version to stderr.
<dt><b>-o filename</b>
<dd>Indicates that the output file name should be "filename". If any other
files are created (such as for graphics,) the basename of the other files will
be "filename" without ".rtf" if it is present in the name.
<dt><b>-P extension</b>
<dd>Use "extension" as the extension for any links to graphics files. The
default for this is "gif".
<dt><b>-T</b>
<dd>Indicates that no table of contents file is to be generated.
<dt><b>-G</b>
<dd>Indicates that no graphics files should be written. The hypertext links to
the graphics files will still be generated. This is a performance feature for
when you are re-translating a document and the graphics have not changed.
<dt><b>"file"</b>
<dd>The file name to be processed. If no file is given, standard input is used.
If standard input is used, the body of the document will be written to standard
output (unless overridden by the -o option.) If a file name appears, the output
is written to "filename" with ".html" as an extension. (If ".rtf" appears as an
extension on the original input file, it is stripped before appending the
".html") </dl><h1>
<a name="RTFToC21">Nested
Lists
</a></h1>
Nested lists can be made from an RTF document by using a different style for
each level of indentation. The styles "bullet list 1" "numbered list 2" ...
represent different levels of nesting. The only rule for use is that no levels
of nesting are skipped. For example, a "ol 3" paragraph must not appear
immediately after a "Normal" paragraph. It must follow a paragraph with a
nesting level of 2 or higher. For examples of nesting see 
<a href="sample_styles.html">
the sample style sheet.</a> .rtf
<ol>
<li></ol>
</body></html>
