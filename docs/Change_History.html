Changes in rtftohtml 2.7.5</h1>
<ul>
<li>	Changed the processing of line breaks (\line in RTF,
&lt;shift&gt;&lt;return&gt; in MS Word). These were being treated the same as
paragraph marks, but they should have been treated as a simple break. Where
this makes a difference is in lists.  <br><br>The filter now correctly renders
the following example as a single list element (i.e. one bullet mark) across
two lines. </ul>

<pre>
*    some list element\line
     more stuff belonging to same list element, but on a different line.

</pre>
<ul>
<li>	MSWord 6.0 for the Macintosh is now using 'RTF ' as the file type for rtf
files, instead of TEXT. This caused rtftohtml to ignore those files in the OPEN
file dialog box. You could not drag and drop those RTF files onto the filter
either. The filter now accepts file types of RTF or TEXT.</ul><hr><p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>!<p>
To make drag-n-drop of MSWord 6.0 RTF files work on your Macintosh, you
<b>must</b>:<p>
1.	Download rtftohtml 2.7.5 onto your Macintosh<p>
2.	Copy <b>ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS</b> of rtftohtml onto a backup disk. Then
<b>REMOVE</b> them from your hard-disk.<p>
3.	Restart your Macintosh, while holding down the OPTION and Apple keys. This
will re-build your desktop. 
<hr><h1>
Changes in rtftohtml 2.7.4</h1>
<ul>
<li>	Fixed a bug where column widths of 1 character caused an infinate loop.
<li>	Fixed a problem for <b>NeXT</b> <b>RTF</b> files where \ followed by a
newline was not being interpreted as a \par mark.
<li>	Footnote numbers were not being reset at the start of each file, so the
sceond document converted would have footnotes starting at &gt; 1.
<li>	Some Word 6.0 RTF symbols were improperly coded as destinations. This
caused rtftohtml to discard the rest of the file (searching for a closing '}'
)</ul><h1>
Changes in rtftohtml 2.7.3</h1>
<ul>
<li>	Modified status bar for <b>Mac</b> platform - it was incorrect for large
files.
<li>	Changed error messages to print line and column information rather than
context.
<li>	Modified <b>MWF</b> processing to produce the correct <b>WMF</b> header
<li>	Added code to recognize that style names of the form "Normal, fred"
actually mean that either Normal or fred are recognized as the style name.
(Implies that style names with ',' in html-trans are incorrect.)
<li>	Added -V option to UNIX version
<li>	Corrected usage message on UNIX version</ul><h1>
Changes in rtftohtml 2.7</h1>
<ul>
<li>	Footnotes are now written to a separate file (filename_fn.html). This
allows the &lt;back&gt; button of all browsers to navigate back from a footnote
to the footnote reference.
<li>	A table of contents file is now generated using the text from all headings
&lt;H1&gt;..&lt;Hn&gt; and any table of contents entries in the RTF. The table
of contents has hypertext links from the TOC entries to their locations in the
main HTML text. The -T option disables this feature.
<li>	Generation of graphics files can be disabled through the -G option. The
filter still generates the hypertext links to the graphics files, but it does
not re-write the files themselves. This improves performance for graphics
intensive RTF files.
<li>	Fixed a bug where table of contents entries and index entries were not
appearing in the HTML output.
<li>	Fixed a bug that caused aborts when graphics occurred in a table.
<li>	rtftohtml now closes off any "text" markup
(&lt;em&gt;,&lt;b&gt;,&lt;cite&gt;) before emitting a paragraph tag. This more
closely matches the HTML DTD and corrects a few error conditions.
<li>	The format of the html-trans file has changed. You will need to use the
html-trans file from this distribution and then add any changes that you made
to customize your html-trans.
<li>	Footnotes no longer require special styles in order to work. This means
that all superscripts can now be translated to &lt;su&gt;&lt;/su&gt; or any
other markup you prefer.
<li>	The Macintosh interface now allows the file Creator to be selected for
graphics, HTML and error files.
<li>	Fixed a bug that caused formatted text in tables to be lost or added to
the wrong cells.
<li>

Notes on rtftohtml 2.5</h1>
<h2>
This release of rtftohtml requires a new version of the html-trans file. Using
your old one will not work. </h2>
The new format file has an additional item added to the <i>.PTag</i> table. An
entry now looks like this:

<pre>
#"name","starttag","endtag","col2mark","tabmark","parmark",allowtext,cannest,DelteCol1,fold
.PTag
</pre>
...

<pre>
"Normal","","\n","\t","\t","&lt;p&gt;\n",1,0,0,1
"pre","&lt;pre&gt;","&lt;/pre&gt;","\t","\t","\n",0,0,0,0

</pre>
The
<i>fold</i> field should be set to zero (0) for all entries except
<tt>"pre"</tt> or <tt>"listing"</tt>. A zero entry allows rtftohtml to insert
newlines <tt>"\n"</tt> into the source so that lines do not get too long in
your HTML file. This feature is designed to make editing/viewing of HTML source
files easier with editors like <i>vi</i>. You must use one (1) for "pre" and
"listing" because newlines are significant characters for these markups.<p>
You must add the following entry to your <i>.PTag</i> table. This is required
to support table translation.

<pre>
# This is a required entry; tables will be formatted with this entry
"_Table","&lt;pre&gt;","&lt;/pre&gt;","\t","\t","\n",0,0,0,0
</pre>
<p>
You must add the following entry to your <i>.PMatch</i> table:<p>


<pre>
# This is a required entry; tables will be formatted with this entry
"_Table",0,"_Table"
</pre>
<h2>
Table Translation</h2>
rtftohtml will now translate tables into preformatted ascii tables. <b>Tables
cannot contain any markup</b>. That is,  <b>BOLD</b>, <i>ITALIC</i> etc. will
be ignored. Also tables cannot contain anchors, footnotes,  or hidden text.<p>
The filter will produce a table that has the same number of columns as the
input. <b>The size of the columns will be proportional to the sizes of the
input columns.</b> Note that there is no guarantee that text that fit in your
original table will still fit in the formatted version. This is because the
point size of input may not be proportional to the fixed size 80-characters
per-column output. If you find that you do not like the look of the formatted
table - you must re-size the columns in your RTF source. <p>
Columns are <b>always</b> separated by two blanks.<p>
Columns can be left justified, right justified or centered.<p>
Merged cells are allowed.<p>
There is <b>no</b> support for decimal aligned data. This just looked too hard
and prone to error. For now, you will have to make sure that all your data has
the same number of trailing digits and stick to right justified text.
<h2>
A REAL Macintosh interface</h2>
The filter now supports drag-n-drop on the Macintosh!<p>
Options are set with menu selections! <p>
The signiture is even registered with Apple!<p>

<h3>
To use rtftohtml on the Macintosh:</h3>
Keep all of the translation files (html-trans, ansi-map...) in the same folder
as the application.<p>
Drag any RTF file onto rtftohtml (requires system 7.) <b>The output files will
be placed in the same folder as your input file.</b> If there are any errors in
translating your file, the error messages will be put into a file called
<i>filename.err</i> . Some errors will cause rtftohtml to exit, others will
not. <p>
<b>Once rtftohtml is started, it will continue to run</b>! This allows you to
translate many documents at a time. You can drag lots of files onto rtftohtml
and it will translate all of them (unless it encounters a fatal translation
error.)<p>
To use non-default translation options, simply start rtftohtml by double
clicking on it. Then choose your option from the options menu. These settings
will remain in effect until rtftohtml exits. <b>The next time you run rtftohtml
you must choose your option settings again.</b><p>
<b></b>You can open RTF files using <b>Open</b>... from the <b>File</b> menu.
This will only work for files with an extension of .rtf (or .RTF). If you want
to open a file without an extension of .rtf, you must hold down the option key
when selecting <b>Open</b>.
<h3>
Options Menu</h3>
The Graphic file extension in the Options menu allows you to change the default
extension for graphic files from ".gif" to an extension of your own
chooseing.<p>
The Inline graphics option will (when set) use &lt;IMG SRC=... markup in HTML
files for graphics instead of &lt;A HREF=...<p>
The Auto Filenames option when set will put the HTML output in the same folder
as the input, with a .HTML extension. If you want to specify your own
filenames, turn this option off. Then rtftohtml will prompt you for an output
file name each time a file is translated.
<h2>
Miscellaneous Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>	All paragraph styles that appear in a document but that do not appear in
the html-trans file will be treated as a warning. This provides you with a list
of paragraph styles that you can then add to html-trans.
<li>	You can tell rtftohtml to discard all of the text with a given paragraph
style. This is done by using the "_Discard" in the .PMatch table. For exampl,
the following entries will discard all text with paragraph styles "toc 1-5" and
"index 1-5". (Word uses these paragraph styles for generating a table of
contents and index. Since these contain page numbers which do not apply to HTML
documents, you may wish to discard them.)</ul>

<pre>
"toc 1",0,"_Discard"
"toc 2",0,"_Discard"
"toc 3",0,"_Discard"
"toc 4",0,"_Discard"
"toc 5",0,"_Discard"
"index 1",0,"_Discard"
"index 2",0,"_Discard"
"index 3",0,"_Discard"
"index 4",0,"_Discard"
"index 5",0,"_Discard"
</pre>
<h2>
Bugs Fixed in 2.5</h2>
rtftohtml was generating "unknown symbol" errors for optional destinations (RTF
with a markup of {\*\xxx ... } The convention for RTF readers is that any
optional destination that a reader does not understand should be silently
ignored. This bug was also causing extra text to be inserted into HTML files.<p>
<p>

<h1>
Bugs fixed in 2.1</h1>
<ul>
<li>	rtftohtml generates empty anchors &lt;a name="myname"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where
the "Named Anchor" feature is used. Xmosaic does not support empty anchors,
although other browsers (including Mac Mosaic) do. I have reported this as a
bug to the good folks at NCSA. I am hoping that they fix this so that I don't
have to patch the filter. Stay tuned. - The good folks at NCSA told me not to
wait, so I revised rtftohtml to create anchors with an extra space:
&lt;a&nbsp;name="myname"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
<li>	Imbedded object were not appearing in the HTML output. Now they are!
<li>	Fixed the usage line to reflect that -H is not a legal option.
<li>	Windows Metafiles were given an extension of ".meta". That has been
changed to ".wmf".
<li>	The Mac version failed to find html-trans, html-map when the input file
was not in the same folder.
<li>	Nested lists were not working properly. How did I miss that one
:?&gt;</ul><h1>
Bugs fixed in 2.0.1</h1>
<ul>
<li>	RTF files created without a leading /pard caused aborts
<li>	Graphics within a HOT text area caused failures instead of generating IMG
links
<li>	Anchor names and Hot Text links were getting an extra "&gt;" inserted.
<li>	Footnotes incorrectly got a "#" at the anchor points.
<li>	Footnotes reference marks were generated without any separating text or
space. Should be generated as [1]
<li>	filter did not understand \tql which is generated in FrameMaker RTF
output. This has been added to reader.c and rtf.h in the source directory.
Eventually, these changes will be incoporated in an official distribution of
the RTF package. (Binary versions of rtftohtml contain the fix)
<li>	FrameMaker RTF assumes that \pard implies \plain - MS Word for the Mac
appears to handle it that way, so I have updated the filter.
