Sample rtftohtml Style Sheet</h1>
This is a sample style sheet produced by Microsoft Word on the Macintosh. It is
designed to demonstrate the various styles that I use. Of course, you can
define your own style sheets and use your own style names - but this should be
a useful example to get you started.<p>

This is Literal HTML as well - but uses the <b>HTML</b>paragraph style, and is
therefore more readable.
<h1>
Lists</h1>
In order to create the illusion of nesting within an RTF document, we need to
create a separate style for each level of indentation. I chose 6 as the maximum
level of nesting that I care about, but rtftohtml can support as many as you
want. This yeilds "ol", "ol 1", "ol 2", ... ,"ol 5". Now, in addition we have
another issue with lists. The HTML bullet and numbered lists will prepend a
bullet or number to your text. If you already have a bullet or number, you have
three options:
<ol>
<li>	Translate your list elements to the HTML &lt;dl&gt; markup, which allows
you to preserve the numbers or bullets that you are using in the RTF form of
the document. This results in some pretty ugly display using Mosaic.
<li>	Strip off the bullet or number, and translate those list items to
&lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;. This is the recommended option.
<li>	Don't use any markers in the RTF form of the document and translate to
&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;.</ol><p>
Both of these options exist with the rtftohtml filter, and I have default
styles for each. In order that the filter can decide where a bullet or number
ends, we need a separator. The filter expects a tab character to be used. It is
<b>REALLY</b> important that if you are using styles that remove you markers
that a tab be present (or you will lose the whole list element.) You also
<b>MUST</b> have a tab character for styles (like the &lt;dl&gt;) that have two
parts . <p>
<p>
Another technique for lists (particularly glossaries) to be entered with the
TERM on one line, and an indented definition on the following line. These are
discussed below.<p>
<p>
Here are the sample TAB separated lists:<p>

<h2>
Ordered List styles</h2>
<ol>
<li>	level zero element - my markers stripped - This is the recommended
style.<ol>
<li>	level one element - my markers stripped - This is the recommended
style.<ol>
<li>	level two element - my markers stripped - This is the recommended
style.</ol></ol></ol><h2>
Un-Ordered List styles</h2>
<ul>
<li>	level zero element - my markers stripped - This is the recommended
style.<ul>
<li>	level one element - my markers stripped - This is the recommended
style.<ul>
<li>	level two element - my markers stripped - This is the recommended
style.</ul></ul></ul><h2>
Glossary styles</h2>
<dl>
<dt>This is areasonably large term
<dd>Here is the definition of the term. Of course this format is used for more
than just definitions.<dl>
<dt>This is areasonably large term
<dd>Here is the definition of the term. Of course this format is used for more
than just definitions.<dl>
<dt>This is areasonably large term
<dd>Here is the definition of the term. Of course this format is used for more
than just definitions</dl></dl></dl><h2>
Dir styles</h2>
<dir>
<li>level zero dir item each 
<li>is less than 20 chars long
<li>and separated by tabs  or
<li>parmarks
<li>and these show up
<li>in my docs as three
<li>columns<dir>
<li>level one dir item each 
<li>is less than 20 chars long
<li>and separated by tabs<dir>
<li>level two dir item each 
<li>is less than 20 chars long
<li>and separated by tabs</dir></dir></dir><h2>
Menu styles</h2>
<menu>
<li>level zero element <menu>
<li>level one element <menu>
<li>level two element </menu>
</menu>
</menu>
<h2>
Multi-Line lists</h2>
In some cases, you want lists to span lines. An example of this is glossaries,
where the term appears on one line and the definition on another. In this case,
the TERM will be defined with one style, and the DEFinition with another.<p>
Here are some samples:
<dl>
<dt>The first TERM<dd>The definition for the first term<dl>
<dt>A nested TERM<dd>The definition for the nested term<dl>
<dt>A level two TERM<dd>The corresponding definition.
<br>
<a name="Here"> </a></dl></dl></dl>
