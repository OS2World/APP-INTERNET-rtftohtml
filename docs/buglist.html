Known Bugs</h1>
Please send bug reports to cjh@cray.com
<ul>
<li>	The error message for Invalid Character Code should tell the user which
translation files need to be updated. </ul><h1>
Feature Requests</h1>
<ul>
<li>	index entries should generate a hypertext index.
<li>	Copy/Paste-link in MSWord for Mac creates a 'live' link. Within a
document, this generates a hyptetext link. This should also be allowed across
documents.
<li>	Footnotes would be a great way to edit and view hypertext links. This was
a feature in the earliest versions of rtftohtml - but was dropped. It should be
put back.
<li>	How about html-&gt;rtf??
<li>	Allow TITLE's to be taken from the text of the document (instead of just
the info-block)
<li>	Make rtftohtml available under DOS and Windows
<li>	Don't print line numbers and column positions for error messages. Print a
context string.
<li>	Allow spaces to separate bullets from text within lists.</ul>
